**Population Growth & Active Transportation Needs Analysis**

**Introduction:**

The aim of this usecase is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of population growth trends across different regions within the City of Melbourne. The objective is to discern potential needs for enhancements in transportation services across various modes available throughout the city. As population densities evolve, ensuring commensurate provisions of stations and stops becomes imperative to facilitate public mobility to and from diverse locales. The overarching goal is to identify areas projected to experience significant population surges and to ascertain corresponding requirements for expanded transportation infrastructure in anticipation of such demographic shifts.

**User Story:**

As a urban planner, I want to analyze historical and projected population data across different regions within Melbourne,
So that I can identify areas with significant population growth and prioritize them for transportation infrastructure developmen..

As a policy maker, I want to receive recommendations on areas for potential development or enhancement of transportation services,
So that I can ensure these areas are equipped with the necessary infrastructure to support anticipated population surgs.</l
As a transportation planner, I want to assess the current capacity and usage statistics of existing transportation modes (bus, metro, tram),
So that I can propose where expansions or enhancements are needed based on population growth forecasts.</l u

**What this use case will teach you:**

Analyzing population growth and sufficient amount of transportation services.
Using "City of Melbourne Population Forecasts by Small Area 2021-2041" dataset we will look at the forecasted population growth based on various features like location, year and value. This will help us understand what has been forecasted population growth in particular locations for particular years and the value of the growth in those areas. Using "City Circle tram stops" dataset we will look into the existing tram stops based on the locations where they exist. This will give us an insight into the number of tram stops in particular location. Using geolocation we can visualize the exact location of these tram stops to aid us into pointing out potential locations for future tram stops. Using "Bus stops" dataset we can see the location of bus stops within Melbourne city, thsi data can aid us to understand the existing number of bus stops in particular locations and if there are need for any more in the future due to the growth in the population. Dataset "Metro Train Stations with accessibility information" gives information about the number of metro stations in various location in Melborune city. This dataset also contains the geolocations of the existing metro stations and using this we can predict if more metro stations will be needed in the future due to the growth in population. The initial approach would be to get the basic information about the dataset and understand the features within each dataset. Later figuring out which features are necessary and discarding the rest that are uncessary and only add to the number of dimensionality of the data. Once the features are understood, the goal will be to clean and remove null values with appropriate tools and techniques. After cleaning, a initial basic visualition to understand the overall distributions of the featues and finding out any correlations amongst them. Finally, using machine learning models to predict the number of transportation services that might be needed to aid the population growth within the city in particular locations. Potenitally, using PowerBI to the convey insights to the stakeholders/business owners/policy makers to help them understand the rise in population and their need for public transportation services, thus helping them plan for such resources beforehand.
